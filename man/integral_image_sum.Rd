\title{Calculate the Sum of a Rectangular Region Using an Integral Image}
\usage{
integral_image_sum(x, r, c, h, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix representing an integral image. It is assumed that `x[i,j]` contains
the sum of all elements in the original matrix from `(1,1)` to `(i,j)`.}

\item{r}{The row index of the top-left corner of the desired region (1-indexed).}

\item{c}{The column index of the top-left corner of the desired region (1-indexed).}

\item{h}{The height of the desired region.}

\item{w}{The width of the desired region.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the sum of the elements in the specified rectangular
  region of the original (non-integral) image.
}
\description{
This function computes the sum of a rectangular region within a matrix `x`, assuming `x` is an
integral image (also known as a summed-area table).
The sum is calculated efficiently using four lookups: `A - B - C + D`,
where `A` is `x[r2, c2]`, `B` is `x[r-1, c2]` (if `r > 1`), `C` is `x[r2, c-1]` (if `c > 1`),
and `D` is `x[r-1, c-1]` (if `r > 1` and `c > 1`).
