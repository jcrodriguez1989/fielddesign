}
\arguments{
\item{b}{A named numeric vector, typically coefficients from a linear model.}

\item{name}{A character string, the name of the coefficient to extract.}
}
\value{
A numeric value, either the extracted coefficient or 0 if not found or non-finite.
}
\description{
This is a helper function to safely extract a coefficient from a named numeric vector.
If the specified `name` is found in the vector `b`, its value is returned.
Otherwise, it returns 0. It also handles non-finite values by converting them to 0.
