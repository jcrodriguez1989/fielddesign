\title{Calculate Spatial Variation Using a Tiling Method}
\usage{
spatial_variation_tiling(
  x,
  exclusion = c("smith", "only_full"),
  return_sums = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or an object coercible to a numeric matrix.}

\item{exclusion}{A character string specifying the exclusion method for block sizes.
Can be `"smith"` (default), which excludes any block whose height `L` equals the matrix height
`n` or whose width `W` equals the matrix width `m`. This means only blocks where `L < n` and
`W < m` are considered.
The alternative is `"only_full"`, which explicitly excludes only the case where block height
`L` equals `n` and block width `W` equals `m` (i.e., the full matrix itself). All other
blocks, including those of full height or full width, are considered.}

\item{return_sums}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, the function includes a data.frame (`sums`)
detailing the position and size of each window's sum, in addition to the vector of sums
(`res`). If `FALSE` (default), only the vector of sums (`res`) is returned.}
}
\value{
A list containing the data frame (`res`) containing spatial variation metrics for each
  tiling combination, including Length, Width, Size (area), plots (number of blocks),
  V (variance estimate), and C.V. (Coefficient of Variation).
}
\description{
This function computes spatial variation metrics for a numeric matrix by dividing it into blocks
of various sizes (tiling). It calculates the coefficient of variation (CV) for each block size
based on the method described by Smith (1938) or by considering only full blocks.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample matrix
set.seed(420)
rows <- 7
cols <- 13
sample_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(rows * cols, 500, 60), nrow = rows, ncol = cols)

# Calculate spatial variation using tiling (Smith's method)
sv_results <- spatial_variation_tiling(sample_matrix)
print(sv_results)

# Calculate spatial variation using tiling (excluding only full field)
sv_results_full <- spatial_variation_tiling(sample_matrix, exclusion = "only_full")
print(sv_results_full)
